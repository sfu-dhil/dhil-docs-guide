Contributors
============

Welcome to the DHIL Documentation Guide Contributors page. Below you will find a list of contributors to this guide, what they worked on, and instructions on adding yourself as a contributor. You can use this as an exercise in using Sphinx, reStructuredText, and Github to edit documentation.

Contributor List
----------------

**Erik Hanson**, Simon Fraser University, Research assistant 
  Wrote and created the guide, including the :ref:`introduction <intro>`, :ref:`documentation tools <tools>`, and :ref:`documentation markup <markup-documentation-markup>` sections.

Add yourself as a contributor
-----------------------------

To add yourself as a contributor to and practice editing documentation, you will need to edit this page.

1. Make sure you have this repository on your local computer as described in the :ref:`Using Github <tools-using-github>` section. You can fork this documentation from the DHIL Github repository `sfu-dhil/dhil-docs-guide <https://github.com/sfu-dhil/dhil-docs-guide>`_

2. Open this page and add yourself as a contributor. The contributor list will be organized in alphabetical order by last name. The contributor list uses the following syntax:

  .. code-block:: rst

    **Full Name**, Institution, Role
      A sentence or two describing your contributions. Feel free to include links to sections you contribute to using this formatting: :ref:`link wording` <link-target>`.

3. Once you've made your changes and added your contributions, :ref:`push your changes <tools-using-github-after>` to your remote Github copy of the documentation.

4. Initiate a pull request by going to your copy of the documentation on Github and click **Pull request** below the green **Clone or download** button. Follow the steps and submit your pull request. It will be sent to the sfu-dhil account for approval. Once approved it will be incorporated into master repository of the documentation guide. Congratulations!
